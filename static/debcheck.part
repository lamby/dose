<h1>Dose-Debcheck: Not Installable Packages</h1>

<h2>Currently checked scenarios</h2>

These checks run daily on <kbd>qa.debian.org</kbd>: 
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../data/dose/debcheck/unstable_main/index.php">unstable,
      main only</a>
  <li><a href="../../data/dose/debcheck/unstable_contrib+nonfree/index.php">unstable
      contrib and non-free, against main background</a>
  <li><a href="../../data/dose/debcheck/testing_main/index.php">testing,
      main only</a>
  <li><a href="../../data/dose/debcheck/testing_contrib+nonfree/index.php">testing
      contrib and non-free, against main background</a>
</ul>

<h2>What it means</h2>
<p>
  We call a package installable if all its (recursive) dependencies
  can be satisfied without violating any conflicts. More precisely, a
  package <i>p</i> is called <em>installable</em> in a package
  repository <i>D</i> if there is a subset <i>S</i> of <i>D</i>
  containing <i>p</i>, and such that for each package in <i>S</i>
  <ul>
    <li>every dependency relation is satisfied by some package in <i>S</i>
    <li>and it is not in conflict with any package in <i>S</i>
  </ul>
  Alternative dependencies and virtual packages are taken into
  account, as well as other aspects of Debian package relations like
  the fact that a versioned dependency is not matched by a virtual
  package, or the fact that there are no self-conflicts via a provided
  virtual package. Packages from a so-called <em>background</em> can
  be used to satisfy dependencies, but we are not interested in
  installability of background packages per se.
</p>
<p>
  In case a package exists with multiple versions in a distribution (which
  may happen in the <i>unstable</i> distribution), only the latest version
  is checked for installability.
</p>


<h2>How it is done</h2>
<p>
  The set of not installable packages is computed by
  the <i>dose-debcheck</i> tool available in
  the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/dose-distcheck">
    dose-distcheck package</a>, the successor of
  the previously used <i>edos-debcheck</i> tool.
</p>
<p>
  See also the check for <a href="outdated.html">outdated packages</a>
  which is much more restricted, but is also much more likely to
  pinpoint the source of a non-installabity.
</p>

<h2>Filing bugs</h2>
Whether a not-installable package deserves a bug report depends on the 
situation:
<ol>
  <li>All packages in the <i>stable</i> and <i>testing</i>
    distribution should be installable, with the exception of packages
    with <kbd>Architecture=all</kbd>. The reason for the latter
    exception is that these packages are always available for each
    architecture, regardless of the fact whether their dependencies
    can be satisfied on that architecture or not. However, when a
    package with <kbd>Architecture=all</kbd> is not installable on any
    architecture then something is wrong.
    <p>
    Normally, a bug should be filed only when a package is not installable
    on any architecture (regardless of the value of the <kbd>Architecture</kbd>
    field of the package). 
    In any case, the situation should be investigated before filing a bug.
    For instance, it may be the case that a package is installable only in
    a multi-arch setting.
  <li>By its very nature, the <i>unstable</i> distribution is expected to
    have many packages that are not installable. However, this should normally
    be temporary. That means that, in addition to the above restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>Bugs should be filed only when the problem exists over an
	extended period of time (say, 1 month).
      <li>Bugs should not be filed when a package is involved in a
      <a href="https://release.debian.org/transitions/">transition</a>
	as these cases are already monitored.
    </ul>
</ol>
This policy has been announced and discussed in

thread</a>. Detected bugs are marked there with user
