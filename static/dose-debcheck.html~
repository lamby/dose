<h1>Dose-Debcheck: Not Installable Packages</h1>

We are currently checking:

<ul>
<li><a href=unstable_main/index.php>unstable, main only</a>
<li><a href=unstable_contrib+nonfree/index.php>unstable contrib and
    non-free, against main background</a>
<li><a href=testing_main/index.php>testing, main only</a>
<li><a href=testing_contrib+nonfree/index.php>testing contrib and
    non-free, against main background</a>
</ul>

<p>

We call a package <i>p</i> <em>installable</em> in some package
repository <i>D</i> if there there is a subset <i>S</i> of <i>D</i>
containing <i>p</i>, and such that for each package in <i>S</i>
<ul>
  <li>every dependency relation is satisfied by some package in <i>S</i>
  <li>and it is not in conflict with any package in <i>S</i>
</ul> 
In other words, it means that all (recursive) dependencies can be satisfied
without violating any conflicts. Alternative dependencies and virtual packages
are of course taken into account.
<p>
Packages from a <em>background</em> can be used to satisfy dependencies.
<p>
The set of not installable packages is computed by the
<a href=http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/dose-distcheckcheck>dose-debcheck</a>
tool, formally known as <i>edos-debcheck</i>.
